Description: Functions for simulating Markov chains using the Barker proposal
    to compute Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimates of expectations with
    respect to a target distribution on a real-valued vector space. The Barker
    proposal, described in Livingstone and Zanella (2022) 
    <https://doi.org/10.1111/rssb.12482>, is a gradient-based MCMC algorithm
    inspired by the Barker accept-reject rule, which combines the robustness of
    simpler MCMC schemes such as random-walk Metropolis with the efficiency of
    gradient-based algorithms such as Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm.
